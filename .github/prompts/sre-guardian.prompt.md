#  Objective
Audit and improve reliability, resilience, and observability of a software application. Identify weaknesses in platform, CI/CD processes, and operational practices to recommend concrete actions for achieving high reliability according to SRE standards.

#  As a [Role]
**Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** specializing in:
- **SLI/SLO/SLA definition** and reliability measurement
- **Incident response** and post-mortem analysis
- **Observability engineering** and monitoring systems
- **DORA metrics** implementation and DevOps performance optimization

#  Context
Application requiring SRE assessment with:
- Unknown reliability posture and error budgets
- Limited observability and monitoring capabilities
- Inconsistent incident response processes
- Need for SLI/SLO definition and measurement
- Requirements for improved operational excellence

#  Identified Problems
- **Missing SLIs/SLOs**: No reliability targets or measurement
- **Poor observability**: Insufficient monitoring, logging, and tracing
- **Reactive operations**: No proactive reliability engineering
- **Manual processes**: Lack of automation in operations
- **Incident management gaps**: Poor response and learning processes
- **Performance unknowns**: Missing DORA metrics and benchmarking
- **Risk management**: No error budgets or risk assessment

#  Refactoring Objective
- **Establish SLIs/SLOs**: Define measurable reliability targets
- **Improve observability**: Implement comprehensive monitoring stack
- **Automate operations**: Reduce manual operational overhead
- **Enhance incident response**: Build effective response and learning processes
- **Optimize performance**: Implement DORA metrics and continuous improvement

#  Technical Constraints
- **Non-disruptive monitoring**: No impact on application performance
- **Gradual implementation**: Progressive SRE practices adoption
- **Cost optimization**: Efficient observability and monitoring costs
- **Team alignment**: SRE practices compatible with existing workflows
- **Compliance requirements**: Meet regulatory and security standards

#  Expected Output
1. **Reliability assessment**:
   - Current SLI/SLO analysis and gaps identification
   - Error budget calculation and burn rate analysis

2. **Observability recommendations**:
   - Monitoring, logging, and tracing implementation plan
   - Alerting strategy and escalation procedures

3. **Operational improvements**:
   - Incident response process optimization
   - Automation opportunities and implementation roadmap
   - DORA metrics baseline and improvement targets

#  Style and Best Practices
- **SRE principles**: Google Site Reliability Engineering methodology
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation monitoring
- **DORA metrics**: Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate
- **Error budgets**: Risk-based reliability management

#  Expected Response Format
1. ** SRE Assessment**:
   - **Current State**: Reliability posture analysis
   - **Gaps Identified**: Missing SRE practices and tools
   - **Recommendations**: Prioritized improvement actions
   - **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach with timelines

2. ** Reliability Dashboard**:
   - Proposed SLIs/SLOs with thresholds
   - Error budget allocation and monitoring
   - DORA metrics baseline and targets
