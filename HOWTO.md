# PromptOps Demo - Lunch & DevOps

## Introduction

> *"We've moved from a world where everyone codes... to a world where everyone prompts.*  
> *But without framework, without governance, AI quickly becomes creative chaos.*  
> *PromptOps is our way of bringing order — transforming the prompt into an engineering asset, in service of AI performance."*

### Paradigm Shift
We're transitioning from **"code is the source of truth"** to **"intent is the source of truth"**.  
With AI, the specification becomes the source of truth and determines what gets built.

## What is PromptOps?

**PromptOps brings engineering rigor to AI prompting** — it systematizes functional and non-functional requirements into precise, reusable prompts that work consistently across domains (development, QA, security, operations) and can be versioned and applied to any codebase with more predictable results.

**Prompt contract template example**: [PROMPT.md](https://github.com/gologic-ca/gologic-copilot-promptops/blob/main/PROMPT.md)

## Demonstration Plan
### **Demo: PromptOps Clean Code Refactoring**

#### 1. **Context Setting - Why PromptOps for Clean Code?**

**Objective**: Show that Copilot alone can produce correct code, but rarely clean code.

**Comparison**:
- **Raw AI** with `"refactor this code"` → Random, Partial, Lacks precision
- **PromptOps** with [Structured Prompt](https://github.com/gologic-ca/gologic-promptops/blob/main/.github/prompts/refactor-clean-code.prompt.md) → Precise, Considers constraints, Role-based scope

**Goal**: Create clear contrast between "raw" AI and "tooled" AI.

#### 2. **Structured Prompt Usage**

**Objective**: Demonstrate intelligent and justified refactoring through structured prompting.

**Prompt**: [refactor-clean-code.prompt.md](https://github.com/gologic-ca/gologic-promptops/blob/main/.github/prompts/refactor-clean-code.prompt.md)

**Features**:
- **Precise**: Considers constraints and works within defined role/scope
- **Deterministic**: Provides repeatable, documented refactoring
- **Format-aware**: Copilot processes this format repeatedly and precisely

**Pro Tips**:
- Ask for comments explaining why each change was made
- Show that the prompt provides deterministic and documented refactoring

#### 3. **Multi-Context Application**

**Objective**: Demonstrate prompt applicability across different languages/code types.

**Usage Flow**:
1. Import `gologic-promptops` project
2. Launch `/refactor-clean-code`

**Test Repositories**:
- **Python**: [aws-lambda-python-examples](https://github.com/gologic-ca/aws-lambda-python-examples)
- **Terraform**: [formation-terraform](https://github.com/gologic-ca/formation-terraform)

#### 4. **Industrial Scale Refactoring**

**Objective**: Show usage in typical PR/issue workflow.

**Issue**: [Workshop-dette-technique](https://github.com/gologic-ca/Workshop-dette-technique/issues)

**Goal**: Demonstrate PromptOps = Guided Refactoring + AI Code Review.

#### 5. **Self-Evaluating Prompts**

**Objective**: Show that prompts can be continuously improved.

**Meta-Prompt**: *"Analyze this prompt according to Clean Prompting principles and suggest improvements."*

**Goal**: Realize that PromptOps is living and evolutionary.
